# Alphabetic_Division_Cipher_Algorithm
The Alphabetic Division Cipher (ADC) Algorithm is a cryptographic method that encrypts and decrypts text and numbers by dividing the alphabet into distinct groups. Each letter is mapped to a numerical equivalent, and shifts or substitutions are applied based on their group.
